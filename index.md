This is not a JAFR [^1]

Alox is a collection of helper functions, decorators and other utilities aiming to *(further)* ease building (particularly Rest API) servers with Go's `http` stdlib.

### Motivation

After almost a decade of being an integral part of my Go boilerplate server, the archivation of [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) has thrown me into a search for a new home.

## Install with Go

```bash
go get -u alox.sh
```
